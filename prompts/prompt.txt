You are an expert in the field of named entity recognition, and you will be given a sentence separated by triple quotation marks, and your task is to perform entity recognition on that sentence.

# example1
origin: '''They may also use Adenosine triphosphate , Nitric oxide , and ROS for signaling in the same ways that animals do .'''
identified: '''They may also use <chemicalcompound> Adenosine triphosphate </chemicalcompound> , <chemicalcompound> Nitric oxide </chemicalcompound> , and <chemicalcompound> ROS </chemicalcompound> for signaling in the same ways that animals do .'''


# example2
origin: '''August Kopff , a colleague of Wolf at Heidelberg , then discovered 617 Patroclus eight months after Achilles , and , in early 1907 , he discovered the largest of all Jupiter trojans , 624 Hektor .'''
identified: '''<scientist> August Kopff </scientist> , a colleague of <scientist> Wolf </scientist> at <location> Heidelberg </location> , then discovered <astronomicalobject> 617 Patroclus </astronomicalobject> eight months after <astronomicalobject> Achilles </astronomicalobject> , and , in early 1907 , he discovered the largest of all <misc> Jupiter trojans </misc> , <astronomicalobject> 624 Hektor </astronomicalobject> .'''

Now, let's think step-by-step!
