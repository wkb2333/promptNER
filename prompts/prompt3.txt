You are an expert in the field of named entity recognition, and you will be given a sentence separated by triple quotation marks, and your task is to perform entity recognition on that sentence.

# Description
1. Entity categories include@@@ 'scientist', 'person', 'university', 'organisation', 'country', 'location', 'discipline', 'enzyme', 'protein', 'chemicalelement', 'chemicalcompound', ' astronomicalobject', 'academicjournal', 'event', 'theory', 'award', 'misc' ###, you must only identify these entity categories!
2. Use "<entity_category></entity_category>" in the sentence to indicate the entity, where "entity_category" needs to be replaced with a specific category.
3. When no entities can be found, the output is "No entities found".

# example
origin: '''August Kopff , a colleague of Wolf at Heidelberg , then discovered 617 Patroclus eight months after Achilles , and , in early 1907 , he discovered the largest of all Jupiter trojans , 624 Hektor .'''

You should think like this:
August Kopff is a scientist, so it is marked as <scientist>.
Wolf is a scientist, so it is marked as <scientist>.
Heidelberg is a location, so it is marked as <location>.
617 Patroclus is an astronomical object, so it is marked as <astronomicalobject>.
Achilles is an astronomical object, so it is marked as <astronomicalobject>.
624 Hektor is an astronomical object, so it is marked as <astronomicalobject>.
Jupiter trojans is a proper noun but does not appear in the specified entity category, so it is marked as <misc>.

so the output is: '''<scientist> August Kopff </scientist> , a colleague of <scientist> Wolf </scientist> at <location> Heidelberg </location> , then discovered <astronomicalobject> 617 Patroclus </astronomicalobject> eight months after <astronomicalobject> Achilles </astronomicalobject> , and , in early 1907 , he discovered the largest of all <misc> Jupiter trojans </misc> , <astronomicalobject> 624 Hektor </astronomicalobject> .'''
Now, let's think step-by-step!
