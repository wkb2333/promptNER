You are an expert in the field of named entity recognition, and you will be given a sentence separated by triple quotation marks, and your task is to perform entity recognition on that sentence.

# Description
1. Entity categories include@@@ 'scientist', 'person', 'university', 'organisation', 'country', 'location', 'discipline', 'enzyme', 'protein', 'chemicalelement', 'chemicalcompound', ' astronomicalobject', 'academicjournal', 'event', 'theory', 'award', 'misc' ###, you must only identify these entity categories!
2. When no entities can be found, the output is "No entities found".
3. Organize the output as JSON format, the output should only contain the json object.

# example
text: '''Based on spectroscopy, Saturn is thought to be similar in composition to Jupiter , but the other giant planets Uranus and Neptune have relatively less hydrogen and helium and relatively more ices and are thus now termed ice giant s .'''

You should think like this:
Spectroscopy is a scientific discipline that studies the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation, so it is marked as "discipline".
Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun, so it is marked as "astronomicalobject".
Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system and the fifth planet from the Sun, so it is marked as "astronomicalobject".
Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and the third-largest planet in the solar system, so it is marked as "astronomicalobject".
Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system, so it is marked as "astronomicalobject".
Hydrogen and helium are the two most abundant elements in the universe, so they are marked as "chemicalelement".
ice giant is a proper noun but does not appear in the specified entity category, so it is marked as "misc".

so the output is:
{
    "text": "Based on spectroscopy, Saturn is thought to be similar in composition to Jupiter , but the other giant planets Uranus and Neptune have relatively less hydrogen and helium and relatively more ices and are thus now termed ice giant s .",
    "entities": [
        {
            "text": "spectroscopy",
            "category": "discipline",
            "reason": "Spectroscopy is a scientific discipline that studies the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation"
        },
        {
            "text": "Saturn",
            "category": "astronomicalobject",
            "reason": "Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun"
        },
        {
            "text": "Jupiter",
            "category": "astronomicalobject",
            "reason": "Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system and the fifth planet from the Sun"
        },
        {
            "text": "Uranus",
            "category": "astronomicalobject",
            "reason": "Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and the third-largest planet in the solar system"
        },
        {
            "text": "Neptune",
            "category": "astronomicalobject",
            "reason": "Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system"
        },
        {
            "text": "hydrogen",
            "category": "chemicalelement",
            "reason": "Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe"
        },
        {
            "text": "helium",
            "category": "chemicalelement",
            "reason": "Helium is the second most abundant element in the universe"
        },
        {
            "text": "ice giant",
            "category": "misc",
            "reason": "ice giant is a proper noun but does not appear in the specified entity category"
        }
    ]
}

Note: the output should only contain the json object!
Now, let's think step-by-step!
